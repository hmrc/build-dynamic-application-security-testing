# build-dynamic-application-security-testing

This repository is responsible for the docker image used by the DAST build jobs.

There are 3 Docker images available:
- `experimental` : mirrors the main branch with most recent changes
- `latest` : a stable version used by the DAST jobs
- `n.n.n` : corresponding to the semver version number for each commit

Unless stated otherwise, all DAST build jobs run against the `latest` tag of this image.

## ZAP add-ons
The ZAP proxy runs with a versioned set of *addons* enabled. The list of currently
supported addons is in the updaters [zap_addons](updater/zap_addons) file.

### Automatic updates
There is a python script that can be used to check for updates against the zap add-ons defined.

A jenkins job has been configured to trigger this daily.

If updates are available, the job will folk the repository, apply the updates to the Dockerfile and raise a PR.

## Making changes
See [updater README](updater/README.md) for more guidance on making changes to the updater.

The image itself has a smoke test that proves the image can be successfully started and stopped in docker.

Running the updater tests and image smoke test can be done from the root directory with: 
```
make test
```

### Updating ZAP
To change the version of zap used, simply update the [zap version](.zap-version) file in the root directory. 

## Release process
When a PR is merged, the *build-dynamic-application-security-testing-docker-image* build job will:
 * bump the semver version number
 * create a new image
 * tag the image with both the new version number and `experimental`
 * publish the images to artifactory
 * trigger the *DAST-canary-experimental* job to ensure that the image is good

If the results of the canary job are satisfactory, the image can be promoted to `latest` via the *promote-artifactory-docker-tag* job.

When running this job, it is recommended that the version tag is used as the `SOURCE_TAG`, not the experimental tag.

### Versioning
The build job uses the *version incrementor* to increment the semver version number.  By default, the minor version will be incremented by 1 on every commit.

To create a new major release, simply update the [major version](.major-version) file in the root directory. 

## Usage
For guidance on how to interact with this docker image, please follow the steps outlined by the [dast-config-manager]("https://github.com/hmrc/dast-config-manager").
